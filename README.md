# odin-recipes
This project is about building a basic recipe website that will consist of a webpage which will have links to a few recipes.
It is to practice all the HTML language that I have learnt which include:
    - Elements, Tags, Comments
    - Text, Bold, Italics
    - Links, Images
    - Git workflow
