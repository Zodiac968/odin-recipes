        <p>From Badmaash restaurant, in Los Angeles, this aromatic tea, called "cutting chai" in India, is served in small glasses because it's so strong ("cutting" is the transliteration of the Hindi word for "half"). The black cardamom gives it a smoky, earthy flavor; we recommend starting with the lower amount. </p>
